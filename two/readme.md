The input file contains a set of trial pulls of a random count of colored
values (red, green, blue) in a number of games. Filter any trials which could
not happen given a starting set of 12 red, 13 green, and 14 blue.

Sum the game index of those possible.

Secondly, find the largest count of each color in each game's trials and take
their product. Sum each of these products.
