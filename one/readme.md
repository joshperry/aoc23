Take the first and last number of each line in `input`, concatenate them to
form a two-digit number, then sum each of these to arrive at the solution
scalar. It is possible that there is one number, which should be both the first
and last digit; it is also possible that there are lines with no numbers.

The second half of the challenge includes detecting and using numbers that are
spelled out (e.g. one, two, three, etc). It is possible that there are
overlapping numbers (e.g. "twone7bac3lmx" == "2ne7bac3lmx", not "tw17bac3lmx"
or "217bac3lmx").
